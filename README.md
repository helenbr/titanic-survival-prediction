# Titanic Survival Prediction

I participated as a speaker in the international event "Machiners: Infinity learning", a workshop organized by EESTEC (Electrical Engineering Students' European Association). This wonderful workshop took place December 2019 in a lovely and peaceful city of Greece, called Xanthi. 14 Members from all over Europe came together to learn the basics of Machine Learning. In that event I was the main speaker and made a number of presentations about Regression, Classification, Neural Networks, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.

The Titanic Survival Prediction was part of the workshop. It was divided in three parts:
1. Data visualization: data analysis to understand missing values, data relations and usefulness of features. 
2. Preprocessing: with the knowledge acquired with the preceding step, apply preprocessing of data including dealing with missing values, drop unuseful features and build new features. 
3. Classification: build classifiers based on the preprocessed data using a variety of techniques.
